Fix My Code Challenge
Background Context: Welcome to the Fix My Code Challenge! This innovative project invites you to dive into an existing codebase and make necessary fixes rather than starting from scratch. Whether you're familiar with the programming language or not, your task is to identify bugs, improve functionality, and enhance code quality within the provided repository, Fix_My_Code_Challenge. Your goal is to refine the code without rewriting it entirely, ensuring that you maintain the original structure while implementing effective solutions. Happy coding!
